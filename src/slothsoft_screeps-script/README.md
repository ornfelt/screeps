## Features

- each room has a fancy overview GUI
- each room has a console which prints most info


### Creeps

- will follow their role until there is nothing else to do
- if they don't find work in their role, they'll take on an arbitrary other role
- display their role next to their circle (→ `DEBUG_ROLES`)
- will be respawned with as many parts as possible after their death
- can self-destruct (console command `selfdestruct(<creepName>)`)

#### Explorer

```js
spawnExplorer(<spawnId>, <flagName>)
```

An Explorer creeps will go through the following phases (it might skip one or more of them if they are no longer necessary):


| Phase              | Description Mode     |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| gotoFlagRoom       | creep walks into the room the flag ist in |
| claimFlagRoom      | creep walks to the controller and claims it |
| createSpawn        | creep creates a new construction side for a base on the flag |
| buildSpawn         | creep works as a Builder and constructs the spawn |
| retire             | creep gives up its role because it is no longer necessary |



### Roads

- the game will remember which tiles are heavily traveled by creeps
- this can be used to build roads, either automatically or manually
- to enable the view on the right, check the `roadManager` memory of a room

<p style="clear: both;" ></p>


### Mayor

- Mayor verifies that the base is in order and warns you
- optionally the mayor can fix some problems and help base building that way


| Warning            | Auto Mode            | Description  |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Builder is missing. | Spawning Builder.  | If there is at least one construction site, the base needs at least one Builder to work correctly. |
| Handyman is missing. | Spawning Handyman.  | If there is at least one structure that needs repairing, the base needs a Handyman to work correctly. |
| Harvester is missing. | Spawning Harvester.  | The base needs at least one Harvester to work correctly. |
| Roads are missing. | I'm building roads.  | There are some well-traveled tiles without roads (set `room.memory.roadManager.visualize` to `true` to see which) |
| Upgrader is missing. | Spawning Upgrader.  | The base needs at least one Upgrader to work correctly. |



### Automatic Building

The `RoomManager` is used to build automatically one building site after the other. 

To configure what should be build, copy the memory of the `rooms.<room>.roomManager.layout` into an editor and replace the regex `(.{50})` with `$1\n` (this will make 50 lines of 50 chars out of the string, instead of the default 50 x 50 char long string. 

After changing the values, replace the line breaks with an empty string again.

The layout contains the following characters:

| Character                                           | Description  | Can be build?  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
|   | plain | `false` |
| ~ | swamp | `false` |
| █ | wall | `false` |
| Ø | controller | `false` |
| © | mineral | `false` |
|  Ⓢ | source | `false` |
| o | extension | `false` |
| w | buildable wall |  `true` |
| r | rampart |  `true` |
| ? | unknown |  `false` |

| `selfdestruct(<creepName>)`                 | the creep will go to the next spawn and recycle itself |
| `spawnCreepForRoom(<roomName>, <roleName>)` | spawns a new creep in a room with a specific role |

### Structure Memory

Potential all structures can have some memory stored at `structures.<id>`. 

| Memory                | Type          | Description  |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| debug                 | `boolean`   | if `true`, the structure will print every time it does something |
| name                  | `string`    | human readable name, useful for error message or debugging |



### Link Memory

| --------------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| type                  | `string`    | `source` if link is a source, `target` if it is a target |
| transferId            | `string`    | sources and targets of a specific `transferId` are matched, so you can have multiple source→target pairs per room |


### Spawn Memory

| Memory                | Type          | Description  |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| debug                 | `boolean`   | if `true`, the spawn will print each time a creep is spawned |


### Creep Memory

| --------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| debug                 |               | `boolean`   | if `true`, the creep will print each tick what it is doing |

| source                |               | `string`    | the ID of the source the creep will use; all creeps will wait for this source to refill instead of searching for alternatives |
| target                |               | `string`    | the ID of the target the creep will prioritize; depending on the role the creeps will handle invalid targets differently: <ul><li><b>Builder, Handyman, Harvester & Storekeeper</b> will silently fallback to different targets</li><li><b>Courier & Miner</b> will wait till the target becomes valid again</li><li><b>Explorer & Upgrader</b> will print an error</li></ul> |

| trainedReplacement    | `number`    | if the creep has already trained its replacement |



## Dev Notes

- Tests run against a mock of the original game: [mock folder](./test/mock)


### Courier Implementation

For the question how to implement couriers, two option present itself: routes stored for each room / base, or for each creep.

| Room                  | Creep Based           |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| ➕ the number of routes and couriers must not be identical | ➖ the number of couriers and routes should be identical |
| ➕ better option for respawning - especially if creeps get killed before spawning their replacement | ➖ creeps need to spawn their replacement before dying |
| ➕ information stays even if all creepy die  | ➖ information gets lost if creeps die unexpectedly |



## Open Tasks

- `Creep#dismantle` can be used for something
- spawn on new world and see what happens and what needs fixing, then document
- test the marked test classes (→ TODO)
